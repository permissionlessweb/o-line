# TERP O-Line - Run Terp Network Nodes on Akash

Make deploying Terp Network nodes onto [Akash](//github.com/akash-network/node)
easy and standardized.

The goal is to have a simple way to launch with a variety of different bootstrapping options.

1. ["normal" boostrap](#shortcuts) - using `fastsync`.
1. [Hand-made snapshots](#snapshot-restore)
1. [The new `state-sync` mechanism](#statesync).

Configuration is achieved using environment variables, with shortcuts available for common setups. Every aspect of the node configuration can be achieved in this way.

Additional features are included to make running a node as simple as possible

1. [Chain configuration can be sourced from a remote JSON file](#chain-configuration)
1. [Genesis file can be downloaded and unzipped in various ways](#chain-configuration)
<!-- 1. [Private keys can be backed up and restored](#private-key-backuprestore) from any S3 compatible storage provider, such as Sia or Storj via [Filebase](https://filebase.com/). -->
1. [Snapshots of a nodes data directory](#snapshot-backup) can be created at a certain time or day and uploaded to an S3 storage provider

<!-- ## Generic image (binary downloaded at runtime)

O-line has a generic base image which can download the required binary at runtime. This is useful for chain upgrades, testnets, or using a different version than O-Line primarily supports.

This generic image provides the O-line scripts and configuration helpers, and nothing else. Set the `BINARY_URL` environment variable to a `.zip`, `.tar` or `.tar.gz` URL, and configure `PROJECT`, `PROJECT_DIR` and `PROJECT_BIN`. Alternatively provide a [Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry) `CHAIN_JSON` to configure everything automatically (where data is available).

Image URL: `ghcr.io/terp-network/o-line:v0.0.12-generic` -->

<!-- ```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: ghcr.io/permissionlessweb/o-line:v0.0.3-terpnetwork-v4.2.2:v0.0.12-generic
    env:
      - MONIKER=my-moniker-1
      - CHAIN_JSON=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/chain-registry/refs/heads/master/terpnetwork/chain.json
      - BINARY_ZIP_PATH=terp_core_linux_amd64
```

More information on the generic image can be found at [/generic](./generic/), and configuration is detailed in depth below. -->

## Networks (pre-built images)

The available docker images can be found [here](https://github.com/permissionlessweb/o-line/pkgs/container/o-line).  They are
tagged with the form `$OLINE_VERSION-$PROJECT-$PROJECT_VERSION`.

|Project|Version|Image| |
|---|---|---|---|
|[terp-network](https://github.com/terpnetwork/terp-core)|`v4.2.2`|`permissionlessweb/o-line:v0.0.12`|[Example](./terpnetwork)|

## Example configurations

Optional configuration options are commented out so you can easily enable them, and the node can be configured further using the docs below.

### Running on Akash

See the `deploy.yml` example file in each chain directory which details the minimum configuration required. Use the [configuration options below](#configuration) to add functionality. Note the commented out persistent storage configuration if needed.

### Running locally/any docker host

See the `docker-compose.yml` example file in each chain directory to run each node using `docker-compose up`. Note that the release images only supports amd64 platforms. You will have to manually compile the o-line image for the arm64 platform.

## Snapshots

O-Line can [import chain snapshots](#snapshot-restore) from almost any location.

Appropriate snapshot configuration is included in most example configurations in the O-Line repository. Check the project directories for more information.

## Examples

See the [_examples](./_examples) directory for some common setups, including:

- [Statesync](./_examples/statesync)
- [Load Balanced RPC Nodes](./_examples/load-balanced-rpc-nodes)
- [Validator and TMKMS](./_examples/validator-and-tmkms)
- [Validator and Public Sentries](./_examples/validator-and-public-sentries)
- [Validator with Private Sentries](./_examples/validator-and-private-sentries)
- [Snapshot Backup](./_examples/snapshot_backup)

## Configuration

Cosmos blockchains can be configured entirely using environment variables instead of the config files.
Every chain has its own prefix, but the format of the configuration is the same.

For example to configure the `seeds` option in the `p2p` section of `config.toml`, for Terp Network:

```yml
TERP_P2P_SEEDS=id@node:26656
```

<!-- The namespace for each of the supported chains in the cosmos omnibus can be found in the `README` in each project directory. -->

The o-line images allow some specific variables and shortcuts to configure extra functionality, detailed below.

### Chain configuration

Chain config can be sourced from a `chain.json` file [as seen in the Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry).

|Variable|Description|Default|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|`CHAIN_JSON`|URL to a `chain.json` file detailing the chain meta| |`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terpnetwork/networks/main/mainnet/morocco-1/genesis.json`
|`CHAIN_ID`|The cosmos chain ID| |`akashnet-2`
|`GENESIS_URL`|URL to the genesis file in `.gz`, `.tar.gz`, or `.zip` format. Can be set by CHAIN_JSON| |`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terp/net/main/mainnet/genesis.json`
|`DOWNLOAD_GENESIS`|Force download of genesis file. If unset the node will only download if the genesis file is missing| |`1`|
|`VALIDATE_GENESIS`|Set to 1 to enable validation of genesis file|`0`|`1`

### P2P

Peer information can be provided manually, or obtained automatically from the following sources:

- `CHAIN_JSON` URL with peer information included.
<!-- - [Polkachu's live peers](https://www.polkachu.com/live_peers). -->
- Any `ADDRBOOK_URL` where the `config/addrbook.json` file is hosted.

See [Cosmos docs](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/configuration.html#p2p-settings) for more information.

|Variable|Description|Default|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|`P2P_SEEDS`|Seed nodes. Can be set by CHAIN_JSON or GENESIS_URL| |`id@node:26656`|
|`P2P_PERSISTENT_PEERS`|Persistent peers. Can be set by CHAIN_JSON or GENESIS_URL| |`id@node:26656`|
|`ADDRBOOK_URL`|URL to an addrbook.json file| |`https://server-3.itrocket.net/mainnet/terp/addrbook.json`

<!-- ### Private key backup/restore

On boot, the container can restore a private key from any S3 storage provider. If this is configured and the key doesn't exist in S3 yet, it will be uploaded from the node.

This allows for a persistent node ID and validator key on Akash's ephemeral storage.

[Filebase](https://filebase.com/) is a great way to use S3 with decentralised hosting such as Sia.

The `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` are both backed up, and can be encrypted with a password.

|Variable|Description|Default|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|`S3_KEY`|S3 access key| | |
|`S3_SECRET`|S3 secret key| | |
|`S3_HOST`|The S3 API host|`https://s3.filebase.com`|`https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`|
|`STORJ_ACCESS_GRANT`|DCS Storj Access Grant token (replaces `S3_KEY`, `S3_SECRET`, `S3_HOST`| | |
|`KEY_PATH`|Bucket and directory to backup/restore to| |`bucket/nodes/node_1`|
|`KEY_PASSWORD`|An optional password to encrypt your private keys. Shouldn't be optional| | | -->

### Statesync

Some shortcuts for enabling statesync. Statesync requires 2x nodes with snapshots enabled.

<!-- Statesync nodes can also be sourced from [Polkachu's Statesync service](https://www.polkachu.com/state_sync) automatically. -->

[See an example](_examples/statesync) of a statesync deployment.

|Variable|Description|Default|Examples|

### Binary download

The node binary can be downloaded at runtime when using the [Generic image](#generic-image-binary-downloaded-at-runtime). All configuration can be sourced from `CHAIN_JSON` if the attributes are available, or configured manually. You will need to set `PROJECT`, `PROJECT_BIN` and `PROJECT_DIR` if these can't be sourced from `CHAIN_JSON`.

|Variable|Description|Default|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|`BINARY_URL`|URL to the binary (or `zip`, `tar`, `tar.gz`)| | |
